# Sorting Algorithms

A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript.
While reviewing some introductory algorithm concepts, I ended up implementing
some of the most common sorting algorithms in an attempt to better understand
their intricacies.

## Instructions

Nothing so far.

## Examples

Nothing so far.

## Roadmap

Version 0.0.1 will have the following features:

* Implement a bottom-up version of the Merge Sort algorithm
* Implement the Insertion Sort and Quick Sort algorithms
* Include a document with a simple outline of the main features for each
implemented algorithm
